As scheduled back in early Fall, today the SSO Pathfinder route in __DEV__ is being deprecated. 

## More Information
- Impact Notes:
  - if you have not already migrated your application to use `dev.oidc.gov.bc.ca` as the new sso endpoint your applications will no longer be able to reach the BC Gov sso service by using dev-sso.pathfinder.gov.bc.ca
