## What's New?

To address current capacity issues related to the limited Platform CPU, we’ve made the difficult decision to temporarily prioritize new project requests, based on the following criteria:

1. Your project addresses the needs of an urgent COVID-19 response;

2. Your project has been designated as high business priority;

3. You have the DevOps capacity in place to support the development of resilient architecture suitable for multi-node deployment.

If your project meets all 3 requirements, we can provision a namespace for you now. If it doesn’t , we ask that the project wait until a new Openshift 4 Platform becomes available in September 2020.

## Why the change?

With accelerated growth over the past few months we’ve maximized our shared resources and hit Platform operational capacity. To ensure Platform high-performance for our community, we’re proactively conserving available CPU to manage load spikes and reserve space for urgent demands.

This is a temporary situation only, which will be resolved when we migrate to OpenShift 4 (OCP 4). Our OCP 4 expansion more than doubles current CPU capacity with new production clusters, plus an additional Azure Cloud offering.

## How long will you be screening new projects?

We anticipate the need to screen and prioritize projects to continue until the new OCP 4 Platform becomes available for application migration. The Platform Roadmap (see attachment, below) targets commencement of application migration to the OCP 4 Platform in September 2020 with completion by December 2020. As OCP 4 becomes available, all incoming projects will have access to the new Platform.

NOTE: Additional communication regarding the OCP 4 migration is coming, but if you want insight into progress, please join the Platform Services Team Sprint Reviews that we run every 3 weeks.  You can join by contacting me directly to get on the meeting invite.
